		programmed to try to reverse the order of the
		calculation before returning and error
	6. Assumptions added to the following some distributions to 
		make computation of CDF more feasible
	7. Truncate modified to divide by the correct normalizing
		constant

		eliminated from the support of Bootstrap RVs.
	2. Pr(X) for elements in the BootstrapRV are now described by
		rational numbers instead of floats.
	3. Bug in transform for RV's with negative support is fixed.
		Transform is now running properly for all supports.

		a floating point value was entered for a parameter,
		the procedure would return 0 for the cdf of the convolution.
		The procedure now works correctly.
	5. Added assumptions to variables in product procedure. No longer
		gives complex functions as output for products that occur in
		the third quadrant.
	6. Corrections made to transform for discrete random variables. No
		longer cuts out parts of the distribution that are not in
		the support of the tranformation, but simply does not 
		transform them.
	7. Corrections made to Transform to account for equality testing with
		SymPy number types
	8. Corrections made to the discrete transform procedure to handle
		situations in which the support of the transformation does
		not cover the full support of the random variable
	9. Added simplification line to end of Truncate procedure

	20. Transform modified to handle transformations by 1/x and log(x)


v0.3.0, 12 JAN 2015

New Capabilities:
	1. The Queue procedure computes the sojourn time distribution
		for an M/M/s Queue for customer n, given k customers
		initially in the queue.
	2. Special MLE algorithms implemented for the Normal, Exponential,
		Poisson and Weibull distributions
	3. Thorough doc strings added for each applpy module
	4. Cache option has been added for functional form conversion and
		expected value procedure. If cache=True, APPLPy stores the
		values in memory to be retrieve later if the function is
		called again. This save significant CPU time on future
		function calls
	5. Doc Strings added for each distribution type
	6. Behavior of +,-,*,/ set to allow random variables to interact
		with floats and ints
	7. == operator will now test for the equality of two random variables

		inverse cdf or a numerical method)
	11. X.latex() command added to generate the LaTeX code for a
		random variable

Fixed Bugs:
	1. Maximum and Minimum are now working properly for piecewise
		distributions. Boundary conditions caused to the procedures
		to use the incorrect segments in the earlier
		implementation
	2. The gamma function is now loaded into the namespace in the
		dist_rv module.
	3. Error message added to Transform to indicate if the user has
		specified an undefined transformation

v0.2.1, 18 NOV 2014

New Capabilities:
	1. Pre-processing code has been added to the beginning
		of several procedures. Errors will be raised
		if a procedure receives bad input.

		options. PlotDist is now capable of using different
		colors and displaying multiple plots simultaneously
	3. Discrete and continuous plots can now be displayed in
		the same overlay
	4. Improved display implemented for continuous random variables.
		Displays large piecewise random variabls more cleanly
	5. MLE and MOM now have options for numerical solving
	6. Procedure added for computing the entropy of random variables

Fixed Bugs:
	1. Start-up script has been modified. The init_session()
		commands for SymPy are entered manually. APPLPy
		can now be imported in an interactive command
		line session
	2. Updates have been made to the way the APPLPy package is
		structured. Importing APPLPy is now less memory
		instensive (does not import all of SymPy, etc)
	3. KSRV now runs properly ... arrays are no initialized
		with 0 instead of None to avoid TypeErrors
		when variables are summed
	4. Minimum and Maximum procedures have been debugged for
		discrete random variables. Old version had issues
		recognizing floating point numbers in the support

	simplified expressions

	3. init.py file modified so that all dependencies are
	automatically imported
