v0.3.0, 12 JAN 2015

New Capabilities:
	1. The Queue procedure computes the sojourn time distribution
		for an M/M/s Queue for customer n, given k customers
		initially in the queue.
	2. Special MLE algorithms implemented for the Normal, Exponential,
		Poisson and Weibull distributions
	3. Thorough doc strings added for each applpy module
	4. Cache option has been added for functional form conversion and
		expected value procedure. If cache=True, APPLPy stores the
		values in memory to be retrieve later if the function is
		called again. This save significant CPU time on future
		function calls
	5. Doc Strings added for each distribution type
	6. Behavior of +,-,*,/ set to allow random variables to interact
		with floats and ints
	7. == operator will now test for the equality of two random variables
	8. Maximum and Minimum will now accept a variable number of arguments
	9. Box-Muller Transformation method implemented to allow for more
		efficient computation of Normal variates
	10. Users can now specify method for variate generation (generally
		inverse cdf or a numerical method)
	11. X.latex() command added to generate the LaTeX code for a
		random variable

Fixed Bugs:
	1. Maximum and Minimum are now working properly for piecewise
		distributions. Boundary conditions caused to the procedures
		to use the incorrect segments in the earlier
		implementation
	2. The gamma function is now loaded into the namespace in the
		dist_rv module.
	3. Error message added to Transform to indicate if the user has
		specified an undefined transformation

v0.2.1, 18 NOV 2014

New Capabilities:
	1. Pre-processing code has been added to the beginning
		of several procedures. Errors will be raised
		if a procedure receives bad input.
	2. PlotDist has been improved to allow for more plotting
		options. PlotDist is now capable of using different
		colors and displaying multiple plots simultaneously
	3. Discrete and continuous plots can now be displayed in
		the same overlay
	4. Improved display implemented for continuous random variables.
		Displays large piecewise random variabls more cleanly
	5. MLE and MOM now have options for numerical solving
	6. Procedure added for computing the entropy of random variables

Fixed Bugs:
	1. Start-up script has been modified. The init_session()
		commands for SymPy are entered manually. APPLPy
		can now be imported in an interactive command
		line session
	2. Updates have been made to the way the APPLPy package is
		structured. Importing APPLPy is now less memory
		instensive (does not import all of SymPy, etc)
	3. KSRV now runs properly ... arrays are no initialized
		with 0 instead of None to avoid TypeErrors
		when variables are summed
	4. Minimum and Maximum procedures have been debugged for
		discrete random variables. Old version had issues
		recognizing floating point numbers in the support

v0.2.0, 17 SEPTEMBER 2014

New Capabilities:
	1. Bayesian statistics module has been added. Capabilities
		include:
		a. Computing posterior distributions
		b. Computing posterior predictive distributions
		c. Computing Jeffreys Priors
		d. Credible Sets
	2. Functionality added for discrete random variables in
		functional forms for the following procedures:
		a. All procedures for changing functional form
			(i.e. CDF to PDF)
		b. All expected value procedures
	3. New Random Variable types added (new distributions are
		listed in the startup menu)
	4. KS Test added to the statistics module

Fixed Bugs:
	1. PlotDist now supports univariate discrete random
		variables
	2. Random Variables no longer default to floating point
		numbers when it produces output. Computation of
		exact distributions is now possible
	3. PlotDist now appears in the iPython Notebook when the
		command %pylab inline is entered

v0.1.2, 30 JULY 2014

New Capabilities:
	1. Capability to work with RV's with symbolic supports was
	added.

v0.1.1, 29 JULY 2014

Fixed Bugs:
	1. Convolution/Product/MaximumIID procedures have been updated
	so that they now function with all distributions. In the
	initial release, they only worked with lifetime distributions.

	2. Expected value procedures were modified to output
	simplified expressions

	3. init.py file modified so that all dependencies are
	automatically imported

	4. Plotting now takes place through the sympy plotting front-
	end. The PlotDist procedure is now capable of plotting all
	functions

v0.1.0, 23 JULY 2014 -- Initial Release
