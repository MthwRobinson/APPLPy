v0.1.3, xx xxxx xxxx

New Capabilities:
	1. Bayesian statistics module has been added. Capabilities
		include:
		a. Computing posterior distributions
		b. Computing posterior predictive distributions
		c. Computing Jeffreys Priors
		d. Credible Sets
	2. Functionality added for discrete random variables in
		functional forms for the following procedures:
		a. All procedures for changing functional form
			(i.e. CDF to PDF)
		b. All expected value procedures
	3. KSRV Random Variable type added
	4. KS Test added to the statistics module

Fixed Bugs:

v0.1.2, 30 JULY 2014

New Capabilities:
	1. Capability to work with RV's with symbolic supports was
	added.

v0.1.1, 29 JULY 2014

Fixed Bugs:
	1. Convolution/Product/MaximumIID procedures have been updated
	so that they now function with all distributions. In the
	initial release, they only worked with lifetime distributions.

	2. Expected value procedures were modified to output
	simplified expressions

	3. init.py file modified so that all dependencies are
	automatically imported

	4. Plotting now takes place through the sympy plotting front-
	end. The PlotDist procedure is now capable of plotting all
	functions

v0.1.0, 23 JULY 2014 -- Initial Release
