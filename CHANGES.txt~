v0.2.1, XX XXX XXXX

New Capabilities:
	1. Pre-processing code has been added to the beginning
		of several procedures. Errors will be raised
		if a procedure receives bad input.

Fixed Bugs:
	1. Start-up script has been modified. The init_session()
		commands for SymPy are entered manually. APPLPy
		can now be imported in an interactive command
		line session

v0.2.0, 17 SEPTEMBER 2014

New Capabilities:
	1. Bayesian statistics module has been added. Capabilities
		include:
		a. Computing posterior distributions
		b. Computing posterior predictive distributions
		c. Computing Jeffreys Priors
		d. Credible Sets
	2. Functionality added for discrete random variables in
		functional forms for the following procedures:
		a. All procedures for changing functional form
			(i.e. CDF to PDF)
		b. All expected value procedures
	3. New Random Variable types added (new distributions are
		listed in the startup menu)
	4. KS Test added to the statistics module

Fixed Bugs:
	1. PlotDist now supports univariate discrete random
		variables
	2. Random Variables no longer default to floating point
		numbers when it produces output. Computation of
		exact distributions is now possible
	3. PlotDist now appears in the iPython Notebook when the
		command %pylab inline is entered

v0.1.2, 30 JULY 2014

New Capabilities:
	1. Capability to work with RV's with symbolic supports was
	added.

v0.1.1, 29 JULY 2014

Fixed Bugs:
	1. Convolution/Product/MaximumIID procedures have been updated
	so that they now function with all distributions. In the
	initial release, they only worked with lifetime distributions.

	2. Expected value procedures were modified to output
	simplified expressions

	3. init.py file modified so that all dependencies are
	automatically imported

	4. Plotting now takes place through the sympy plotting front-
	end. The PlotDist procedure is now capable of plotting all
	functions

v0.1.0, 23 JULY 2014 -- Initial Release
