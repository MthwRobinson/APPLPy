Current APPLPy Bugs:

1. Need to simplify "weird" output (i.e. - - - x instead of -x),
	may need to do a sequence of simplify commands (also
	may need to add an assumption for the 't', see HW1.pynb
	for example of when procedure fails)
2. MGF(X) comes out as a piecewise function for gamma,
	may need to add assumptions
3. Cannot handle functions that include abs(*) (Sympy problem)

To do list:
1. Update documentation on site to include RangeStat and OrderStat wo
	and MaximumIID with n unspecified
