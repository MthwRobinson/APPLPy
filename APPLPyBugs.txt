Current APPLPy Bugs:

1. MGF(X) comes out as a piecewise function for gamma,
	may need to add assumptions
2. Cannot handle functions that include abs(*) (Sympy problem)
3. Credible Set seems to return incorrect upper values in 
	the Bayes module
4. Errors in distributions (see e-mail from Andy)
   Convolution works with rational when all inputs are positive

To do list:
1. Update documentation on site to include RangeStat and OrderStat wo and MaximumIID with n unspecified
2. Add Wiki page for Transform
3. Add 'short cuts' for Weibull and Gamma distributions into the CDF
	procedure
