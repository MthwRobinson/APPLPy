Current APPLPy Bugs:

1. MGF(X) comes out as a piecewise function for gamma,
	may need to add assumptions
2. Cannot handle functions that include abs(*) (Sympy problem)
3. CDF throws an error when an out of support value is plugged
	in, should return 0 or 1
4. Credible Set seems to return incorrect upper values in 
	the Bayes module
5. Errors in distributions (see e-mail from Andy)

To do list:
1. Update documentation on site to include RangeStat and OrderStat wo and MaximumIID with n unspecified
2. Add Wiki page for Transform
