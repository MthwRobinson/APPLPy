Current APPLPy Bugs:

1. Need to simplify "weird" output (i.e. - - - x instead of -x),
	may need to do a sequence of simplify commands (also
	may need to add an assumption for the 't', see HW1.pynb
	for example of when procedure fails)
2. Support for the CDF representations of Discrete RVs
3. X+X for U(0,1/2) works with 0.5 but not with Rational(1,2)
4. MGF(X) comes out as a piecewise function for gamma,
	may need to add assumptions
5. Cannot handle functions that include abs(*) (Sympy problem)

To do list:
1. Update documentation on site to include RangeStat and OrderStat wo
	and MaximumIID with n unspecified
